# ImageSlider
# image-slider
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a dynamic image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This slider will showcase different images with smooth transitions..
## Project Description:
You will develop an image slider that can display multiple images in a rotating fashion. The slider should include navigation controls to move between images and should be responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes. The provided example features an image of Machu Picchu, but you can use any set of images you prefer.
## Key Features to Include:
## HTML Structure
- Create a container for the image slider.
- Include placeholders for images and navigation controls
## CSS Styling
- Style the slider container and images.
- Add transitions and animations for smooth sliding effects.
- responsiveness for various screen sizes.
## JavaScript Functionality
- Implement the logic for navigating between images.
- Add functionality for auto-sliding images at a set interval.
- Handle user interactions with navigation controls (e.g., previous/next buttons)
 ## Optional Enhancement:
If you wish to make the UI more interactive, consider the following enhancements:
## 1. Thumbnail Navigation: 
Add a row of thumbnails below the main image slider, allowing users to click on a thumbnail to view the corresponding image.
## 2. Caption and Description:
Include a caption or description for each image, displayed dynamically as the images change.
## 3. Touch/Swipe Support: 
Implement touch/swipe functionality for mobile devices to enhance user interaction.
## 4. Fade Transitions:  
Instead of sliding, use fading transitions for a different visual effect.
## Technologies to Use:
### 1.HTML: 
   To create the structure of the image slider.
### 2.CSS: 
   To style the slider and add animations and transitions.
### 3.JavaScript: 
   To implement the functionality for navigating between images and handling user
